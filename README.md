# Food Vision – Milestone Project

## Overview
Food Vision is a computer vision project focused on classifying food images using deep learning and transfer learning techniques.  
The project was built as a milestone to move from learning individual concepts to building a complete, end-to-end image classification system.

Rather than jumping directly to the final model, the project follows a gradual learning path, where each notebook represents a key step in building the final solution.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into learning stages followed by the final milestone project:

### 1. Transfer Learning – Feature Extraction
Introduces transfer learning by using pretrained convolutional neural networks as fixed feature extractors.  
Focuses on model architecture, input pipelines, and baseline performance.

### 2. Transfer Learning – Fine Tuning
Builds on feature extraction by unfreezing selected layers of the pretrained model.  
Explores how fine-tuning affects performance and training stability.

### 3. Transfer Learning – Scaling Up
Covers scaling strategies such as using larger datasets, adjusting batch sizes, and managing training efficiency.  
Emphasizes safe training practices and performance monitoring.

### 4. Food Vision – Final Milestone Project
An end-to-end food image classification system that combines all previous concepts.  
Includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and experimentation with different architectures.
